This script will introduce you to three techniques I regard as elementary for any aspiring (computational) social scientist: first, the collection of digital trace data via either scraping the web or acquiring data from application programming interfaces (APIs); second, the simulation of human behavior using agent-based modeling; and, third, the analysis of text in an automated fashion (text mining).

The script is hosted using bookdown. You can find it here: <https://bookdown.org/f_lennert/book-toolbox_css>.
