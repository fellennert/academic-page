Based on courses I have been teaching throughout the last couple of years, I have put together the following scripts. "An introduction to R" aims to familiarize you with R from scratch, using tidy principles. "Toolbox CSS" introduces you to web scraping, agent-based modeling, and a bit of text mining. 

Currently, I am working on a new course which is dedicated to text mining in the social sciences exclusively, to be held at the University of Leipzig during the Spring/Summer Term 2022. Please feel more than free to use the courses for your own learning and do not hesitate to share them with others who might benefit from the material. 

As a useR, I am of course standing on the shoulders of giants, as was asserted by Hal Varian in a [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/business-computing/07program.html), and I have tried to do my best to give credit where credit is due. If you think that you spotted an instance where I failed to do so, feel free to call me out and drop me a line so that I can fix this. Same holds for whatever error you might find, they are of course my own.
